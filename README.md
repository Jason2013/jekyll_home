# Nick Gerace

Hello! Currently, I am a rising-senior and computer science major at Wake Forest University who specializes in Unix-based operating systems and experiments in video game design, cyber security, and container software. 

My day to day work includes shifts as an Information Systems Analyst (Team Lead) specializing in macOS/Unix as well as the Chapter Trustee for the current roster of ACM officers. As the previous President, I founded our university's first ever hackathon and curated talks and entertaining events for nearly 200 students. For summer 2018, I will be interning at NetApp on the Cyber Security team. Please feel free to contact me at any time!
