Hello! I am Nick, a senior and computer science major at Wake Forest University who loves and specializes in security. 

My day to day non-academic work includes guiding the current roster of ACM officers as Chapter Trustee as well as taking shifts as an Information Systems Analyst (Team Lead). As the previous ACM President, I founded our university's first ever hackathon and curated talks and entertaining events for nearly 200 students. As Team Lead, I lead student employees and work with full-time staff as the point of contact for macOS/Unix solutions.

Outside of work, I am the creator and developer of "BlueWarden", a single console for defensive security tools. You can find its repository among others on my website or GitHub.

In summer 2018, I interned on the Enterprise Information Security team at NetApp. In fall 2018, I am interning while at school under the new Security Operations Center at NetApp. Please feel free to contact me at any time!
