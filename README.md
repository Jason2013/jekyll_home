# Nick Gerace

Hello! Currently, I am a rising-senior and computer science major at Wake Forest University who specializes in Unix-based operating systems and experiments in game design, cyber security, and container software. 

My day to day work includes shifts as an Information Systems Analyst (Team Lead) specializing in macOS/Unix as well as the Chapter Trustee for the current roster of ACM officers. As the previous President, I founded our university's first ever hackathon and curated talks and entertaining events for nearly 200 students. For summer 2018, I will be interning at NetApp on the Cyber Security team. Please feel free to contact me at any time!
