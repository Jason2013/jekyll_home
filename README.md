# Nick Gerace

Hello! I am a rising-senior and computer science major at Wake Forest University who loves and specializes in security. 

My day to day non-academic work includes guiding the current roster of ACM officers as Chapter Truste as well as taking shifts as an Information Systems Analyst (Team Lead). As the previous ACM President, I founded our university's first ever hackathon and curated talks and entertaining events for nearly 200 students. As Team Lead, I lead student employees and work with full-time staff as the point of contact for macOS/Unix solutions.

For summer 2018, I am interning at NetApp on the Cyber Security team. Please feel free to contact me at any time!
