Hello! I am Nick, a senior and computer science major at Wake Forest University who loves and specializes in application security and software development. 

My daily, non-academic, work includes guiding the current roster of ACM officers as Chapter Trustee as well as balancing two security jobs. As the previous ACM President, I founded our university's 
[first ever hackathon](https://acm.cs.wfu.edu), "WakeHacks 2018" and curated talks and entertaining events for nearly 200 students. 

Outside of work, I am the creator and developer of "[BlueWarden](https://github.com/nickgerace/BlueWarden)", a single console for defensive security tools. You can find its repository among others on my website or [GitHub](https://github.com/nickgerace).

In summer 2018, I interned on the Information Security team at NetApp with a focus in Offensive and Application Security. In fall 2018, I am continuing my internship while at school under the new Security Operations Center at NetApp. In addition, I am working for WFU Information Systems as a Security Engineer. Please feel free to contact me at any time!
